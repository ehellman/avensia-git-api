So I am trying to follow this guide [here](https://dev.to/dariansampare/setting-up-docker-typescript-node-hot-reloading-code-changes-in-a-running-container-2b2f)

It's going quite well however right now I can build, up crashes. I have noticed problems with package.json and node_modules ending up in `/` instead of `/home/node/app`. Still no clue, darn paths..
